# 🦠 Power BI COVID-19 Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze COVID-19 data. It provides key insights into case trends, testing efficiency, fatality rates, geographical distribution, and comparative analysis across different regions. The dashboard integrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL, and Power BI visualization techniques.

## ✨ Features
- 📊 **Case Trends Analysis**: Tracks daily, weekly, and monthly case trends.
- 🏥 **Testing Efficiency**: Measures testing rates and positivity ratios.
- ⚰️ **Fatality Rates**: Calculates case fatality rates across different demographics.
- 🗺️ **Geographical Insights**: Visualizes COVID-19 spread using map charts.
- 🌍 **Comparative Analysis**: Compares key metrics across regions.
- 🎛️ **Interactive Filters**: Enables users to drill down data by country, date range, and other parameters.

## 📂 Data Sources
- 📜 Official COVID-19 datasets from government health organizations.
- 🌐 World Health Organization (WHO) reports.
- 🏛️ Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 repository.
- 📊 Additional datasets from publicly available sources.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- 📊 **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- 🗄️ **SQL**: For data extraction, transformation, and querying.
- 🐍 **Python**: For data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- 📑 **Excel**: For data cleaning and structuring.

## 🔍 Implementation Steps
1. 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, structuring, and handling missing values.
